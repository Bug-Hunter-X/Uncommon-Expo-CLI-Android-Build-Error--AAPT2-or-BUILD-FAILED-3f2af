The solution involves several steps:

1. **Clean the project:** `expo prebuild --clean` 
2. **Update Expo and SDK versions:** Check your `package.json` and `app.json` for outdated versions of Expo and the Android SDK. Update them to the latest stable versions.
3. **Check your Android environment:** Verify your Android SDK installation, environment variables, and Gradle versions.  Make sure everything is up-to-date and configured correctly. (Refer to the Expo documentation for proper environment setup). 
4. **Invalidate caches:** Restart your IDE (Android Studio or other), and try clearing caches.
5. **Examine logs carefully:**  The complete build logs usually provide more clues, look for detailed error messages within the logs. 
6. **Test on a physical device:** Sometimes, emulator issues can lead to such errors.  Testing the build on a physical device is also useful in debugging these complex issues.
